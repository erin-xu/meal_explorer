# Meal Explorer

A multiplatform Flutter app that helps users find new and nutritious meal options. The app allows users to generate a meal plan by specifying a calorie target and browse recipes, menu items, and grocery products by specifying a search query or calorie, fat, protein, and carbohydrate values. 

The Dart source code can be found in the `lib` folder. The screenshots below demonstrate the functionality and show the user interface of the app.

The home screen displays 3 random recipes at the top, which can be viewed by swiping horizontally. Tapping the recipe opens the recipe website in the app.

Clicking on 'Meal Plans' in the bottom left corner opens a modal that allows users to generate a day meal plan based on a calorie target. The meal plan includes breakfast, lunch, and dinner recipes. Nutrient information is displayed at the bottom. This meal plan is randomly generated each time, so the user will receive two different meal plans even when entering the same calorie target in twice.

The search icon in the top right corner of the home page allows users to search for recipes, grocery products, and menu items using a search query.

The search results are displayed with a picture and nutrient information. Once again, tapping the recipe opens the recipe website in the app.
